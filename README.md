# Assignment4
A Java code for tracking the player's moves in a linked list (a continuation of Assignment3). Then, before printing out the maze at the
end, cycle through all the nodes of the linked list and change the cell value of each grid spot where
the user has been to a number like 8 or 5 or 3 or any integer other than 0 or 1. This way the grid
print out at the end will show the player's path.
Secondly, track the number of moves of the player makes and print that out at the end as well.
